Key Findings
Regularization Benefit: Ridge regression with α=100 provides the best performance, improving test RMSE by 0.0018 compared to linear regression.
Optimal Alpha: α=100 gives the best balance between bias and variance, reducing overfitting while maintaining good predictive power.
Feature Importance: The most important features for predicting house prices are:
Median income (positive correlation)
Geographic location (latitude/longitude, negative correlation)
House age (positive correlation)
Model Stability: As alpha increases, the coefficients become more conservative (smaller absolute values), which helps with generalization.
The analysis demonstrates that Ridge regularization is beneficial for this dataset, particularly with higher alpha values, as it helps prevent overfitting and improves test set performance. The improvement, while modest, shows that the L2 penalty helps the model generalize better to unseen data.
